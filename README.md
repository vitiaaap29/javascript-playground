Set of JavaScript examples, useful for learning and teaching tricky and challenging aspects of JavaScript language.

Getting Started
================
Download Visual Studio 2013 and the latest version of Google Chrome. Then hit F5 and you`re ready to go.

Roadmap
=======
* Get rid of dependency on Visual Studio and ASP.NET by rewriting back-end into [node.js]
* Make examples suitable for quick demos without need to comment and uncomment script tags
